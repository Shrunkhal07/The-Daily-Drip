                    <p class="lead">Every cricket fan in India has an opinion on this debate. But most of them argue
                        with emotion, not data. We decided to settle this the only way that matters — with numbers. And
                        the story they tell isn't what either fanbase wants to hear.</p>

                    <p>Let's be honest: comparing Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli is like comparing two different eras
                        of Indian cricket. Tendulkar debuted at 16 against Pakistan in 1989, when Indian pitches were
                        dustbowls and helmets were optional. Kohli burst onto the scene in 2008, into a world of T20
                        leagues, better fitness science, and flat batting paradises.</p>

                    <p>But numbers don't care about eras. They only care about runs, averages, and consistency. So we
                        built a comparison framework across every major statistical dimension. Here's what we found.</p>

                    <p>At first glance, Tendulkar dominates in volume — more runs, more centuries, more years. But look
                        closer: Kohli's ODI average of 59 absolutely destroys Tendulkar's 44.83. That's not a small gap.
                        That's a generational gap.</p>

                    <div class="pull-quote">Kohli averages 59 in ODIs. Tendulkar averaged 44.83. That's a 32% difference
                        — and it's the single most uncomfortable stat in this entire debate.</div>

                            <div class="sc-label">ODI Avg: 75.3 · Test Avg: 66.6</div>

                    <p>Kohli's peak was statistically more dominant than Tendulkar's — and it's not close. Between 2016
                        and 2019, Kohli was operating at a level that no Indian batsman has ever sustained. An ODI
                        average of 75+ over three years is borderline absurd. In Tests during this period, he
                        accumulated over 3,500 runs in 35 matches with 14 centuries.</p>

                    <p>Tendulkar's peak, while magnificent, came with more inconsistency. He had brilliant series
                        followed by quiet ones. Kohli, at his best, was a machine — relentless, format-agnostic, and
                        almost robotically consistent.</p>

                    <p><strong>Advantage: Kohli.</strong> Peak for peak, the numbers are clearly in his favour.</p>

                    <h2>The Decline Curve: Here's Where It Gets Uncomfortable</h2>

                    <p>This is the section Kohli fans won't enjoy.</p>

                    <p>Tendulkar played his last Test at 40. His average in his final 5 years (2009-2013) dipped to
                        about 40 in Tests — a decline, yes, but he still contributed regularly. More importantly, he
                        played 200 Test matches. He stuck around, absorbed the criticism, and kept showing up.</p>

                    <p>Kohli's decline was steeper and more public. After his imperial 2016-2019 run, his numbers fell
                        off a cliff:</p>

                    </table>

                    <p>The century drought between November 2019 and September 2022 — nearly three years without a
                        hundred in any format — is unprecedented for a player of Kohli's calibre. Tendulkar never had a
                        comparable dry spell at any point in his 24-year career.</p>

                    <p>And then there's the retirement itself. Kohli retired from Tests at 36, with his average sliding
                        below 47. Tendulkar played until 40, in part because of what he owed the game, but also because
                        he could still compete. Kohli's Test exit felt more like an escape from declining numbers.</p>

                    <p><strong>Advantage: Tendulkar.</strong> He aged more gracefully, played longer, and never had a
                        three-year century drought.</p>

                    <h2>ICC Tournaments: Who Showed Up When It Mattered?</h2>

                    <p>This is where the debate gets spicy.</p>

                    <p>Tendulkar played six World Cups. He was brilliant in 1996 (523 runs) and 2003 (673 runs), but in
                        2007 (World Cup exit in group stage) and 2011 (where his final contribution was 85 runs across 9
                        innings, excluding one century in a non-knockout game), his tournament record is mixed.</p>

                    <p>Kohli? The 2023 ODI World Cup was his masterpiece — 765 runs at an average of 95.63, including
                        three centuries and the record-breaking 50th ODI hundred. He was named Player of the Tournament.
                        In the 2024 T20 World Cup, he scored a match-winning 76 in the final against South Africa. And
                        in the 2025 Champions Trophy, he was instrumental in India's win with a century against
                        Pakistan.</p>

                    <p>However — and this is the uncomfortable part — India lost the 2023 World Cup final. Kohli's
                        individual brilliance couldn't deliver the trophy in what should have been his crowning moment.
                        Tendulkar, for all his flaws, was part of the team that won the 2011 World Cup.</p>

                    </table>

                    <p><strong>Advantage: Kohli.</strong> Four ICC trophies to Tendulkar's one. This is significant and
                        often overlooked in the GOAT debate.</p>

                    <h2>The Intangibles: Captaincy, Fitness, and Cultural Impact</h2>

                    <p>Kohli led India to the No. 1 Test ranking for five consecutive years and captained a historic
                        series win in Australia in 2018-19 — something no Indian captain had ever achieved. His
                        captaincy record of 40 wins in 68 Tests makes him India's most successful Test captain by number
                        of wins.</p>

                    <p>Tendulkar was a comparatively poor captain. His stint as ODI captain in the late 1990s was
                        largely forgettable, and he himself admitted captaincy affected his batting.</p>

                    <p>On fitness, Kohli revolutionized Indian cricket's approach to physical conditioning. The Yo-Yo
                        test, the emphasis on athletic fielding, the visible transformation of Indian cricket's fitness
                        culture — that's Kohli's legacy, and it arguably matters more than any statistical record.</p>

                    <p>Tendulkar's cultural impact, however, is immeasurable. He carried the expectations of a billion
                        people for 24 years. He made cricket a religion. Streets emptied when he batted. No player
                        before or since has had that kind of emotional hold on an entire nation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Advantage: Split.</strong> Kohli as captain and fitness icon. Tendulkar as cultural
                        deity.</p>

                    <h2>The Business of Being GOAT</h2>

                    <p>Here's a dimension nobody talks about in GOAT debates: commercial value.</p>

                    <p>Kohli earned an estimated ₹634 crore ($75 million) in 2022 alone, making him one of the
                        highest-paid athletes on the planet. His brand portfolio includes Agilitas (his own athleisure
                        venture), investments in startups like Digit Insurance, Rage Coffee, Blue Tribe, and the World
                        Bowling League. He's not just a cricketer — he's a business empire.</p>

                    <p>Tendulkar was commercially massive for his era — the first Indian cricketer to sign a ₹100 crore
                        endorsement deal (with MRF). But adjusted for today's market, Kohli's commercial dominance is on
                        another level.</p>

                    <p><strong>Advantage: Kohli.</strong> As a brand and businessman, he's in a different league.</p>

                    <div class="verdict-box">
                        <h3>🏏 The Daily Punch Verdict</h3>
                        <p>There is no single GOAT. The data shows two completely different kinds of greatness:</p>
                        <p><strong>Tendulkar wins:</strong> Career longevity, Test run volume (15,921 vs 9,230), Test
                            centuries (51 vs 30), Test average (53.78 vs 46.85), no major decline phase, cultural impact
                            that unified a nation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Kohli wins:</strong> ODI average (59 vs 44.83), ODI centuries (54 vs 49), higher peak
                            performance, ICC trophy count (4 vs 1), captaincy record, fitness revolution, commercial
                            dominance.</p>
                        <p>If you value longevity and Tests — Tendulkar is your GOAT. If you value ODI dominance,
                            tournament wins, and peak intensity — it's Kohli. The honest answer is that they're both
                            right, and anyone who says otherwise is arguing with emotion, not data.</p>
                        <p><strong>But here's what makes Kohli fans uncomfortable:</strong> his Test career — 9,230 runs
                            at 46.85 with a brutal decline phase — doesn't belong in the same conversation as
                            Tendulkar's 15,921 at 53.78. In the format that truly tests greatness, Sachin is in a
                            different stratosphere.</p>
